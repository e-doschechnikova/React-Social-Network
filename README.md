# My social network

This is my first "serious project" in which I use the react stack, redux, css modules.
in this project, I am implementing a social network in which you can exchange messages, add and search for friends, create posts, change information about yourself, log in. For these actions, I will use requests to the server, and for asynchronous actions, I will use redux thunk.

the project is still in development, but you can view the current version by doing the following in the root directory of my project:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`
